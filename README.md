# 3D Flower Garden with Butterflies

Welcome to the 3D Flower Garden project! This project is an innovative concept of building a 3D garden with flowers and butterflies using OpenGL and C.

## Project Description

The 3D Flower Garden project is an immersive visualization of a flower garden, created using OpenGL. The garden includes flowers and butterflies, with special effects and dynamic animations. The goal is to create a visually appealing and interactive simulation.

## Features

- Realistic 3D flowers with petals and stalks.
- Butterflies flying around the garden.
- Basic lighting and shading for a more realistic effect.
- Interactive controls to navigate through the garden.
